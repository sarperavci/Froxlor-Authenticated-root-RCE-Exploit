# Froxlor Authenticated root RCE Exploit

This authenticated RCE exploit was found by me and rejected by the Froxlor team. I am releasing it now because there is no point in keeping it private if it's a feature.

For live demo, you can watch [https://github.com/sarperavci/froxlor-Authenticated-root-RCE-Exploit/demo.mp4](https://github.com/sarperavci/froxlor-Authenticated-root-RCE-Exploit/demo.mp4)
